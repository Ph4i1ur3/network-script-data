## 2. WHAT INFORMATION IS COVERED?

> We may collect certain information when you use the Adriftus Services such as your usernames and email address (more information below). We do not receive or store payment details.

## 2.1. What information might we collect from you? 

When you sign up for, download, use or play using Adriftus Services then we will collect certain information from you. The information that we collect varies depending on the particular Adriftus Services used, but this may include:

A. Technical Details. When you use, play or access the Adriftus Services we or third parties on our behalf may collect technical details about the device you are using, including: internet and/or network connection (including IP address); and any console device identifier/client brand details.

B. Your Activities. When you use or access the Adriftus Services we or third parties on our behalf may collect details of how you use our services, including: metrics information about when and how you use the services; traffic data; language preferences; chat-logs; friends lists; achievements; scores; gameplay statistics; time spent playing.

C. Your Communications. If you contact us (e.g. via email) or post in chat sessions, forums, on our social media pages, or other areas of the Adriftus Services, we may collect and maintain a record of your contact details and the content of your communications.

D. User Accounts. To access certain Adriftus Services (e.g. games or forums) you may need to create a user account. Or if you sign up to a newsletter, you will be asked to provide us with certain information. This will be displayed to you at the time you start to use the applicable Adriftus Services (e.g. when you sign up for a newsletter) and may include your name, username, a photo or avatar, email address, and contact information.

Some of the information types referred to above may be collected on an aggregated or anonymised (e.g. hashed) basis, or we may use it or share it in an aggregated or anonymised way, for research or analysis into the way our services operate and are used.

## 2.2. What about the storage of payment details? 

The processing and storage of payment details is a matter for the relevant platform and the applicable payment methods/processors. Adriftus Studios will not receive, process or store any of your payment details. This is because the payment transactions themselves are completed through the relevant platforms (e.g. PayPal) via the user account you have associated with that platform account.

We and third parties on our behalf also collect information about you via cookies and other advertising tracking technologies.

The information we hold will primarily be stored and processed in Canada and United States. All information we hold is stored on our secure servers which we own or license from appropriate third parties. We use industry standard procedures and security standards to prevent unauthorised access to our servers, however no online service or website can be completely secure, so please protect the account information in your possession as well.
