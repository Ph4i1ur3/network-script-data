name_of_the_embed:
  type: single
  content: |-
    This is the context of a message outside of the embeds - generally only use this for pings; formatting by Discord's mention syntax:
    `<@user_id>`, `<@!user_id>`, `<@&role_id>`, or `<#channel_id`.

      When making blocks of text, you can avoid long lines of
      text that would otherwise require text-wrapping by
      typing a |- at the beginning, such as done here in this
      description. Line breaks can be manually used using \n
      or parsing the <n> tag.
      There are a few basic styles you can take advantage of:
      *Italics*, by surrounding text in asterisks (\*_text\*) or a single
      set of underscores (\_text\_);
      **Bold**, by surrounding text in double asterisks (\*\*text\*\*);
      __Underline__, by using double underscores (\_\_text\_\_);
      ~~Strikethrough~~, by using double tildes (\~\~text\~\~);
      `Code`, by using backticks (\`code\`).

    fields:
    - name: Advanced formatting
      value: |-
        Beyond these basic styles, you can also start a blockquote with a right-pointing angle bracket (>):
        > Hello.
        Or mark sensitive content behind a spoiler using two pipes (\||):
        ||This is hidden until clicked||
        there's also code-blocks you can create within embeds:
        ```yml
        my_script:
          type: task
          script:
          - narrate "Hello, <player.name>."
        ```
    - name: Using server emoji
      value: |-
        While default emoji work like you would expect them to, we use DiscordEmoji objects to
        format our objects, for example: `<discordemoji[adriftusbot,custom,676335667571326988,discodog,true].formatted>`
        would format a formatted discodog. or, you can just use <a:discodog:676335667571326988> for an animated emoji;
        or <:nimsysdog:739972704119029894> for an unanimated emoji. Note that if you parse this, you must escape the tagmarks.

      title: this will be the same for every page sent as embeds.
      color: 15859456
    page:
      1:
      - description: |-
          **Page Control Information**:
          This would be displayed on the first page. 
          for good consistency, the set of control arrows with the page numbers:
          <:left:747195307900796938> `( 1 / 2 )` <:other_left:747195307925831710>
          is good for displaying the page; and to the right of that, notable page names
          would be ideal, formatting the present page in bold.
        fields:
        - name: Controls
          value: "<:left:747195307900796938> `( 1 / 2 )` <:other_left:747195307925831710>

      - description: |-
          **Field Information**:
          Fields have two required keys and one optional key. `name` and `value` are required, 
          and the `inline` key is an optional key that can be specified to arrange fields in pairs of three.
          be mindful of how information looks; you can get quick easy layouts on sites like [`[DiscoHook]`](https://discohook.org).
        fields:
